# jsonParser
A JSON parser for java with only needing to provide a string that is in a JSON format and will turn it into a usable object in java.

UNFINISHED!!!
DOES NOT WORK YET

5/9/23:
  As for now you will input a json string and it will make it into a json object, that is not yet made and not yet ready to use!
